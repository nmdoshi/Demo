11,No,If there was not a desired vehicle available the reps explored all options including competitors to assist in finding an available vehicle. This level of service brought me back not to their competitor but the company as this reflects on their overall quality.
18,No,The rental car guy was cute.
36,Yes,They were idiots.  The car had problems and they were unable to fix them or provide a replacement without a lot of hassle.
45,No,"It was good, got the car we wanted without much of a wait in picking up and dropping off"
74,No,"no wait for pick up and drop off was great, help with luggage, face to face directions to hotel, recommended entertainment for area."
83,Yes,"I thought the representative handled the initial situation badly.  The company was out of cars, with none coming in that day.  Then the representative tried to find us a car at another franchise.  There they were successful."
140,No,Everyone was very helpful.  The car was ready for me on time and I didn't have to wait a long time at the counter.
191,Yes,what customer service

398,No,"""sorely lacking"""
414,No,Person very friendly but only person working counter

442,No,They moved me in and out quickly. The shuttle driver drove like a maniac.
473,No,"We dealt very little with customer service, and we only walked to the car assigned for us, and drive away."
488,No,The car rental company that I went with had very good customer service. They were out of a certain car I reserved and gave me a upgrade and apologized.
530,No,"Experience was fine, usually try to get you to upgrade."
560,No,"It took quite a long time, about 45 minutes to an hour.  Several attendants but the line was about 20-25 deep.  Check out was very quick.  A minute or two was all.  Overall a pretty good experience."
587,No,I would like them to be more speedy.  Also I would like the rental company to check the car for previous damage while I am standing there.
626,No,"The only unpleasant aspects of interacting with personnel from the company was having to wait in a long line since most windows were closed. Also, they tried really hard to sell additional insurance coverage which was obnoxious."
686,No,"Was average, nothing out of the ordinary.  Took a long time to get the car."
690,Yes,"We needed a minivan on very short notice to drive out of town to a funeral.  Enterprise staff worked hard to find us one, and they did. We smashed the car into a parking garage pole.  Since we had purchased the comprehensive insurance we didn't have to go through all of the B.S."
719,No,good
759,No,"I haven't actually spoken with anyone from a car rental organization for quite a while.  When I did (probably about three years ago), I believe they were polite enough. However, I always hate to wait in lines when we have a lot of luggage."
771,Yes,Customer Service was fine. They were able to upgrade me for $2 a day to the next class...that was nice.
772,Yes,They were too pushy in trying to sell insurance.
782,No,They were helpful and accommodating when I wanted to change the color of the car.
803,Yes,speed up the rental process!
827,Yes,The counter girl seemed confused and she had lost our reservations. They directed us to one car and then came running out to tell us that was the wrong car and to come back to the counter. Getting directions took forever and they weren't accurate.
841,No,The representatives were helpful and considerate; the only problem encountered was finding the rental car in the parking lot.  I really would have appreciated it if an employee had gone out to get the car and drive it up to the front.  I feel that would h
900,No,Excellent response dealing with child seat.
916,Yes,"For the most part, they it's been really good service.  I usually rent from the airports because it's much cheaper.  Once they charged me over and I had to hunt down the accounting department to get my money back.  it was a pain."
930,No,The customer service was excellent
931,No,"Customer service was average.  They did not go above and beyond.  They did, however, do more than the minimum."

956,No,Experience was fine
976,Yes,For the most part they are very nice.

1060,Yes,No problems encountered
1064,No,Very satisfactory. Employees were very helpful in providing directions.
1069,No,they could not provide driving directions
1085,No,"Based on the customer service personnel I encountered most recently, I would say it is vastly preferable for the personnel to be able to at least pretend to care whether the customer ever actually receives a car rental that was reserved months in advance."
1087,No,Everything was great.  The line was a little long to get the car but it was a good experience.
1098,No,Customer Service was quick and friendly.  I received my car with little hassles.

1148,No,they were a little slow
1162,Yes,Friendly and very well informed
1166,No,"I was happy that we arrived very late and there was still a live person to help us get our rental.  We had no problems with the car, and returned it easily."
1171,No,I would like the reps be knowledgeable about the immediate area around the rental agency and or have maps for the area available free of charge.
1190,No,"I had to wait in line for a long time to get and return the vehicle.  Also, the car was not clean."
1225,Yes,"The people where generally good, but overworked.  The printer went down.  The poor woman working the register was about to pull her hair out.  Customers were yelling at her, not me, but she was not in charge of the issues."
1229,No,price too high and location off premise too far
1243,Yes,The car I reserved was not ready.
1246,No,"Had problems with windshield wipers that affected usability.  Problem was not solved.  Customer service was NOT helpful. Because of franchising, I was not able to get help from an office other than the one I rented from.  I had driven 60 miles from that location and there was another location 2 miles from where I was staying."
1277,Yes,It was fine
1282,No,not applicable
1307,No,"I have had a few recent rentals that have taken a very very long time, with no offer of apology.  In the most recent case, the agent subsequently offered me a car type on an upgrade coupon and then told me it was no longer available because it had just be"

1346,Yes,outlining the cost of gas per gallon charged if vehicle was returned without full tank

1361,Yes,they were trying to satisfy me even though my wife tells me I was being rude
1365,Yes,"The only complaint I have is getting in fast, and not waiting in long lines. When I pick up a car. Or return it."

1460,No,friendly people
1480,No,They forgot to ask for my driver's license.

1492,No,customer service was OK
1499,No,"We had a small problem with the size of car we reserved being available. The company was able to send another car over from a different location. We were delayed in getting on the road, but were satisfied with the car."
1545,Yes,None I  rarely rent cars
1547,No,"Customer service was great, but I wish they had searched the car when I returned it.  I left my Palm Pilot in the backseat for 2 days before I noticed it was missing!  Fortunately the car was still in the lot when I called and they were able to ship it to me."
1557,No,they were fine.
1645,No,More agents during peak hours
1646,Yes,Most windows were closed.
1647,Yes,the agent obviously hates their job more than I hate mine and that surprises me

1757,No,they were extremely helpful and did whatever they could to help us.
1760,No,"States have different rules and regulations pertaining to speed, radar detectors, even when light should be on.  Customer services reps should have a handout or be knowledgeable of a particular state's laws."
1779,Yes,They were very good and took care of what I needed. Very quick.
1782,Yes,The customer service people were very nice.  During my vacation I locked my keys in the car.  The rental company sent someone out with a new set of keys to unlock the car.
1802,No,the service at the airport was very convenient.  no lines at the service desk.
1808,Yes,"Agents usually try to get you to take insurance and pay for full tank of gas.  Some persist even after a ""no thanks.""  Even after noting preferences on my frequent user file that says I don't want them."
1831,No,Customer service was fine.  We didn't care for the off site location.  Would not use that car rental company at that airport again.
1854,No,"We had an issue with our last vacation car rental.  Instead of crediting the rental amount, the company issued a certificate for one free day (could have been 2, I don't exactly remember).  I would have rather had the credit for our current rental."
1897,Yes,long lines waiting for the rental pick.
1934,No,"needed: shorter lines & cleaner cars, friendlier reps"
1954,No,Everything went fine.  Folks were friendly and informed.
2029,Yes,"It was okay, we got the car quickly, which is the most important thing"
2061,Yes,"The rental clerk was nice, but I swear she was deaf.  We had to repeat everything twice and although we had a reservation she treated us like a walk in, so that all the information that we gave to reserve the car we had to repeat all over again."
2064,Yes,the rep was friendly but it was so loud in there that I could not hear what she was saying. I HATE having to walk across a big lot with all of my bags in search of my car which is always in the furthest corner.
2068,No,I expected customer service to recognize that I rent from their company every single day. I expect some difference for this loyalty.
2082,No,"The person who assisted me was not very friendly and didn't like to give the details I was asking for (gas refill packages, insurance, etc.)."

2317,No,"It was a good experience, received an upgrade at no charge."
2329,Yes,"Customer service was hopeless. They care less about your having reserved a certain car, but they are quick to upgrade you to a better one when you start causing a fuss. It would be nicer if no fuss was required and you got upgraded by default."
2341,No,"it seems that they never have the class of car that I ordered.  also, the last time I got there earlier than I thought and they wouldn't let me have the car until the time that I had requested it because their computer wouldn't allow it."

2516,Yes,My last rental experience for leisure was fine -- no service issues to speak of.
2558,No,Customer Service at Alamo was RUDE. We waited in line for over an hour to get our car. Car was bad. Had to change it few days later. Another family traveling with us was upgraded to a larger car as they were out of the type of car booked.
2565,No,service was excellent
2570,No,No problems
2574,Yes,customer service was OK
2584,No,No complaints.
2601,Yes,People were nice.  Service was fast.

2775,No,Waiting line is too long.  They need to speed up the process.
2820,No,"Our customer service representative was polite and well-dressed. He smiled appropriately and answered my questions, not from a rehearsed script, but from his own frame of reference. He shirt was neatly pressed and his hair was professionally coifed."
2851,No,they were fast and friendly.
2855,No,"I guess it really DOES ""try harder."""
2870,Yes,"I never had to deal with customer service. The bus dropped me off at my car, when I returned the car, I had my receipt at that moment. I then got on the bus and left. Never having to wait in a line for customer service."

3156,Yes,"The people were very nice.  Directions to and from our hotel, the rental company location and tourists attractions were given and they were happy to help us out."

3177,No,Customer service was fine as I recall. No problems.

3327,No,Its nice when you get in your car and it has already been started up with the A/C or heating going.
3348,No,My main concern was that the price quoted on the internet was not the price that I was invoiced.   I had to call the provider and straighten it out but it took time and was a hassle.

3387,Yes,The service was polite and professional. I was attended to quickly and courteously.

3416,Yes,Customer service was very good
3420,No,service was good.
3430,Yes,"the better the customer service, the sooner the vacation starts"
3441,Yes,Customer service is horrible. I reserved through on-line which did not indicate/state I had to provide proof of insurance during pickup. The manager denied the reservation and after long and rude argument he finally gave in.
3541,Yes,"Slow, long lineup"
3556,No,"Very good. willing to drop me off and pick me up from location, upgraded me to higher level due to availability"

3705,No,Did not have any problems. My car was ready on time and it was the one I had asked for.
3707,Yes,"Last time I rented a car was when I went skiing with my whole family.  We got a Chevy Blazer.  We didn't think it was as large as a Ford Explorer, so we asked to switch.  The agent was very nice and gave us the Ford Explorer."
3712,No,"I did everything on-line - never talked to an agent during booking.  There were no problems, even though I had to switch car sizes after initial reservation. Agent on duty for pick-up was courteous."
3716,Yes,The company was overwhelmed by the number of customers verse the number of available agents and they were not articulating their situation to the customers well enough. I think we waited for almost 3 hours just to get a rental car. It was ridiculous.
3721,Yes,I didn't get the car I was told would be available.  There were some hidden fees added on to the price I was quoted.
3725,No,I recently renteda car and they were outstanding.  The customer service rep was very helpful and courteous.  They even let me extend my rental by a couple of hours for no charge at all. I was very pleased with my experience and I would go back.
3771,No,Provide more frequent pickup from the airport.
3785,Yes,The car should have been brought to us instead of us trying to find it in the lot.
